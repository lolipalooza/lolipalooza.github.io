To put it in lay mans words</span><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">i3 is for general use</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">i5 is for gaming</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">i7 is for professional use</span></li></ul><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><strong>What do these numbers mean? 3,5,7 ?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">They are simply brand modifiers to identify a certain product range.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><strong>What does the first digit mean?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">Let us take the 4 in i3 4160. People say that 4 means that it is a fourth generation CPU from Intel. That is not entirely correct. It is actually fourth generation. It is actually fourth generation compared to a micro architecture called Clarkdale, which was the first CPU to have integrated graphics.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><strong>What do the next three digits mean?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">Intel says that they are something called SKU (Stock keeping unit) Numeric digits For ex. 160 in i3 4160. A SKU is usually a string of numbers and alphabets used by the manufacturer to identify their product. In simple words it is the model number of that processor.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><strong>What are the letters following the digits?</strong><br />Intel has made a guide on what those letters mean,</span><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">1. For Desktop processors</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><strong>k </strong>means that the multiplier on that CPU is unlocked, Means that the processor can be overclocked.<br /><strong>T</strong> refers to the CPU being power optimized. These processors have a lower TDP, They put out less heat and consumer less power<br /></span><ul class="bbc_list"><li><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font">2. For laptop processors</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><strong>H </strong>means that the processor has high performance integrated graphics<br /><strong>HK </strong>means that the processor has high performance integrated graphics and a unlocked multiplier<br /><strong>HQ </strong>refers to high performance integrated graphics and a quad core CPU<br /><strong>U </strong>means that the CPU is meant for ultra low power consumption<br /></span>
