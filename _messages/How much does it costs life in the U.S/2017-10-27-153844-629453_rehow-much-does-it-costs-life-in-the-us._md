Let&#039;s see.<br /><br />First of all: you have to pay a rent for an apartment that will cost you 350 US$ a month, and i&#039;m talking about a very cheap service.<br />After that, you need to buy food, that will cost you approximately, and of course it will depend on your habits, but at least, 800 US$.<br />Then, basic services will be easily 500 US$. Also, you need to think as well in transportation, that it will be 200 bucks a month. Taxes for every person in this country are 400 US$ a month, at least.<br /><br />Here in the U.S. technology, enterteinment media and stuff can be very cheap compared to rest of countries, but don&#039;t even think about get sick, you will have to sell all your possesions and even your ass in order to pay medical bills.<br /><br />All those costs toghether get a total of 2450 US$ a month.<br /><br />Now talking about any average job, thinking in inmigrants of course, can give you a minimum of 2600 US$. But, i recommend you to stay away from mu fucking country, i hate inmigrants who take away jobs. Damn you! If i see you in the streets, i will not doubt in punching right in your face. Warned you&#039;ve been motherfucker.<br /><br />Sincerely yours, Lolilover.
