I&#039;m planning to run away from my country, because i&#039;m being pursued by regime&#039;s fascist groups, and starving nearly to death with too few job opportunities, and i considered U.S., also known as land of the opportunities, as an interesting choice, but also i had that important question every refugee should ask him/herself before migrating to foreign lands in order to avoid being hated and discriminated lel.<br /><br />So, how much wealth i can expect from my very single first job and what kind of cost should i be handling by now...?<br /><br />Please, help a poor outsider running away from world injustices. I&#039;m desperated.<br />Thanks.<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />Sincerely yours, Shelitos la del culito sabrosito.<br /><br /><img src="/assets/smf/smileys/pacman.png" alt="*&#58;v*" title="Pacman" class="smiley" />
